Note: I originally wrote this in 2016, but rewrote and reformatted it on 2024-07-25 for my new blog.

There are plenty of guides out there that explain how to put a Cisco AP in SE-Connect mode via SSH, but what about the GUI?

Pre-Requisites

For this guide, you'll need to first convert your Cisco AP to autonomous mode. To convert my AP, I used an [excellent guide by Rasika Nayanajith](https://mrncciew.com/2013/12/13/ap-conversion-using-mode-button/).
