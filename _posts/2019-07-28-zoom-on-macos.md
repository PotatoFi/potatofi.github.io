At WLPC in 2018, I presented on packet analysis, or spectrum analysis, or something... but nobody cared, because during the presentation, I used the keyboard zoom feature in macOS to zoom in on areas of interest during live demos. That really grabbed a lot of people's attention! I've received a lot of questions about how I do it, so here's how!

1. Open **System Preferences** (the fastest way is to press `Command` + `Space`, type `Preferences`, and press `Enter`). ![](assets/zoom-in-macos/system-preferences.jpg)
2. Open **Accessibility**, then **Zoom**. ![](assets/zoom-in-macos/zoom.jpg)
3. Check **Use Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom**.
4. To zoom in, hold down the `Control` key, and scroll down either using two-finger scroll on your trackpad, one-finger scroll on your Magic Mouse, or scroll with whatever mouse you have. To zoom out, hold down the `Control` key, and scroll up.
