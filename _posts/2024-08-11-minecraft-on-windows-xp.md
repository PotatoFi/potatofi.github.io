If the Windows XP subreddit is a good indicator, it feels like Windows XP is entering a renaissance period. XP-era games are just old enough to be considered “vintage”, and there’s even new development for Windows XP applications, like the web browser [Supermium](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium).

I’ve been dabbling with Windows XP on my EeePC 1005HA, a fantastic little netbook by ASUS that was *the* singular way for me and my friends to afford a “modern” laptop computer in early 2010’s. Back then, I alternated between Windows 7 and various flavors of Linux (conveniently swappable thanks to the bootable SD card slot), but for my EeePC today, XP seems like the most appropriate OS. A few weeks ago, I wanted to ~~relive the experience of playing Minecraft at 15 fps~~ show my kids what Minecraft was like back in the old days.

To run Minecraft on Windows XP, you need two things:

- A version of Java for Windows XP
- A Minecraft launcher for Windows XP

# Java

For Java, [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsxp/comments/t5k3rm/the_true_latest_working_version_of_java_on_xp/) documented the last version that will install and work on Windows XP, which is `Java 2017 version 152`, which appears to be the same as `Java 8 Update 152` that can be [found on Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/jre-8u152-windows-i586).

This version does give a warning about requiring a newer version of Windows, but installs without further complaint.

# Minecraft Launcher

To launch Minecraft, I had great success with the [latest version of MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download). I simply placed it in a folder, launched MultiMC, let it find Java, signed into my Microsoft account, and proceeded to download Minecraft 1.0.

That’s all it took! Now I just need to find a tree to punch.
