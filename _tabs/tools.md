# Interactive Spectrum Chart

The radio spectrum is a complicated place, far too complicated for static charts to accurately represent, so I made an interactive spectrum chart. With it, you can zoom in and out, pan across the spectrum, and turn various technologies and labels on and off. It's fun for exploring, and maybe useful for training or quick reference.

Need to rotate objects in Hamina Network Planner? Until we can get this added, here's a little external tool that you can use to get the job done.

# PotatoFrames for Wireshark

This Wireshark profile is designed to make Wi-Fi packet analysis simple and readable. It's a fork of the MetaGeek Wireshark Configuration Profile, and is based on the original frame colors from MetaGeek Eye P.A., with significant updates being added with the release of MetaGeek Tonic (now ~~MetaGeek Chanalyzer 6~~ the [MetaGeek App](https://shop.metageek.com/products/metageek-app)).

# Packet Potato

A few years ago, I taught a soldering class at the [Wireless LAN Professionals Conference](https://www.thewlpc.com/). We needed a soldering project, and I thought it would be fun to have a badge for WLPC, so the Packet Potato was born. It's either a really terrible packet analyzer, or a really terrible spectrum analzyzer (I'm not sure).
