Welcome to the PotatoFi Blog, where I blog about technology, projects, Wi-Fi, and retro computers and videogames.

# What This Blog is For

I use this blog as a public notepad, and sometimes refer back to it when I can't remember how to do something. Hopefully it helps you too!

# Wi-Fi

I work in the Wi-Fi industry, specifically for Hamina Wireless. Over the years, I've worked as a technical trainer, sales engineer,
technical marketing engineer, and product owner for various Wi-Fi tools and infrastructure products.

## Wi-Fi Certifications

Early in my Wi-Fi career, I grabbed a bunch of IT and Wi-Fi-related certifications, including:

- CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Mobility+
- Ekahau ECSE Design, ECSE Troubleshoot, ECSE Advanced
- CWNP Certified Wireless Network Administrator, Security Professional, Design Professional, Analysis Professional

I am also CWNE #233 (Certified Wireless Network Expert). At this time of this writing, there are about 500 of us worldwide.

# Vintage Computing

A few years ago, I bought a Macintosh SE on eBay for $99, and it snowballed from there. My collection of vintage machines
centers around late 80's and early 90's Macs, but I have some PCs as well.

# Retro Videogames

As a kid, I didn't have access to videogames, except for the display models at Walmart and occaisonally a friend or relative's house.
Since I'm now the same age as an adult, I get to buy all of the videogames that I wanted as a kid but couldn't get. Emulation is super cool,
but I'm all about the original hardware, and getting crisp analog video out of it. It's also fun to do with my kids.
